# Hello

It's 15th February 2021. We're locked down in the Highlands of Scotland – a fantastic part of the world to be confined to. We are a family of four, with a dog^[(Scallywag, also known as Scally, Wag, and MacWag)], and therefore we have been out walking a lot this year, glad for the opportunity to stretch our legs and minds without getting too close to anyone else.

During such walks, my attention wanders off with the scudding clouds, and is brought back _here and now_ by my body. That's a fine relationship, and one worthy of exploration. Perhaps one of the most explored and least known relationships, the mind-body connection interests me, and so much of my writing here will be in the form of an enquiry.

For years, this enquiry has been generalised – just _trying stuff out_ – but since studying with Alexander Technique teacher [Bruce Fertman](https://peacefulbodyschool.com/) I have been asking with a purpose: finding the [_I-and-Thou_ body](/notes/the-body-of-i-and-thou/) of [Martin Buber](/notes/i-and-thou/).

Sometimes I will describe and narrate my experiments. Where I do so, I am implicitly inviting you to join in. If you have time, room, and inclination to join in, please do so, and let me know what you find. If you like, you can [[contact|give me feedback]].

<!--
As a caveat to the writing on this blog, I might add that I have used some prompts that I met elsewhere – *movement meditations*, _awareness exercises_, and the ongoing ramblings of my mind. Some of that might be interesting, some of it may not make much sense or seem on-topic. [Hashtag **so be it**](https://twitter.com/#sobeit).

This was a 28-day daily writing project. There is a theme running through, but some of the writing is a bit shoddy, not well-expressed, or lost. I have indicated my view of the status of each as `seedling`, `budding`, or `evergreen` (hat-tip to [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com) who I lifted [this idea](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens) from). Everything first written is a `seedling`. I'm currently reviewing them (over a year after first draft) and editing them where necessary. If I'm satisfied that I would never edit it again, an article attains the `evergreen` status, otherwise it starts `budding`.

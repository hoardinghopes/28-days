## Seriously, thanks for your feedback.

I am so grateful to you, that I googled _a thank you poem for form submission_, picked one, and pasted it here. Especially for you. Not anyone else.

### It Doesn’t Seem Enough

<pre class="verse">
I want to tell you "Thank you,"
But it doesn’t seem enough.
Words don’t seem sufficient–
"Blah, blah" and all that stuff.
<br>
Please know I have deep feelings
About your generous act.
I really appreciate you;
You’re special, and that’s a fact!

### Would you be serious?

Well, it's a fair question. Perhaps I should, but I'm not sure it supports the experiments I'm doing. If you've read a few pages, you'll likely realise by now that _seriousness_ has its own physicality, and that _light-heartedness_^[or _levity_ or _silliness_ or _playfulness_, etc., etc.] has a different physicality.

Specifically, _serious_ (at least in the context of such a request) carries a weight, a requirement to behave _and look_ appropriate(-ly). It's outside-in. By contrast, the physicality of _light-heartedness_ is revealed in its very name: it's light, it emanates from the heart (it's inside-out). It is _opening_, and therefore inviting a Buber-like^[Buberian? Buberish?] _encounter_.

_Light-hearted_ wins every time. After which – no matter serious or playful – we all die anyway.

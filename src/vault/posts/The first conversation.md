We had recently moved out of London in order to bring up very young children. I still had a two-hour commute to work each day. I was constantly at the behest of the clock and permanently exhausted. My wife was carrying our young family.

Every Wednesday I rushed back to attend an evening class. One evening, I arrived just in time for the teacher to instruct us to _close your eyes and ask your body, how are you just now_?

I'd had a terrible day and had missed all my connections on the way home, so I got back, wolfed down some food and ran out again. It was both exhausting and infuriating. _How am I?_ I silently spat out all the frustrations of the day.

There were tears in my eyes. But none in my story. Frustration, exasperation, even. But no tears. I heard an echo of the original question: _how are you just now in your body?_

So I asked my body. And everything cracked open. _You're fine_ was the reply, and _I am here for you. I wish that you knew and noticed that. Let me support you. I love you._

I listened further and learned that, beyond the melodrama of the day, _I am fine_, and that _I am unconditionally loved_.

My body woke me up and blew apart the story that it's just little (ego) me against the world. _I will always be here for you_.

That's a gift I wish for everyone.

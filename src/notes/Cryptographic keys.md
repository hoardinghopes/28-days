## What are cryptographic keys?
**Public-key cryptography** is a system that uses pairs of keys. The owner keeps their private key _private_, and makes their public key _public_. The private key is used to encrypt, and the public key allows others to decrypt.

This means that I can sign a message with my private key, and when the recipient verifies that message using my public key, they know that it comes from me.


## What's the purpose?
Crytographic keys are used to ensure that:
- that something is definitely sent by the sender,
- it remains private in transit (can't be read or altered),
- that it's only open-able by the intended recipient.


## How does it work?
Both sender and recipient have pairs of keys. They share their public keys between them. Now they are able to encrypt messages using the sender's private key and the recipient's public key. Such messages can only be decrypted using the sender's public key and the recipient's private key.


## What actually happens

The keys are generated by a one-way algorithm[^fn-oneway]. The keys are, in fact, really large numbers that are mathematically related to one another. This relationship means that whatever has been encrypted by a public key can be only decrypted with the corresponding private key.

[^fn-oneway]: A *one-way* function is extremely hard to reverse engineer, so you can't use the public key to figure out the private key. _Extremely hard_ is a technical term based on the increasing mathematical capacities of computers, i.e. it isn't impossible but may take an unfeasibly long time to do. This will change as quantum computing becomes reality, i.e what is currently secure will become less so, and new methods of encryption will be required.

## Why is this important?

The internet is not a private space, whether it's bad actors (hackers, spammers, etc.) or advertising companies, our Personally Identifiable Information (email addresses, date-of-births, National Insurance numbers, etc.) represents valuable data. However, there are regular occasions when our activities should remain private.

The most obvious example is online shopping – we need our credit card details to remain a secret between us and the bank. Many websites hand the payment process off to the bank (or Paypal and Stripe, etc.) so that they don't touch our details. The bank does the transaction and then informs them that it was successful.

Businesses need internal conversations to remain confidential. The Oxford lab that developed the Astra-Zeneca vaccine was under attack by actors in other countries, presumably to get information about what approach they were taking to develop the vaccine. After all, the first few vaccines to market are going to sell billions.

Now that many more of us are working from home, data breaches are harder to discover and rectify, so it becomes more important to prevent those breaches in the first place by appropriate use of encryption techniques.

The GDPR regulations require organisations to be really careful with Personally Identifiable Information (email addresses, date-of-births, National Insurance numbers, etc.) If a company is breached, it is liable for massive financial penalties.

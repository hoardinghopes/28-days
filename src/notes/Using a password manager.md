You use a password manager, right? Right?

If you don't, how on earth do you manage to remember your passwords?

I started using LastPass about 10 years ago, I think, just as the number of accounts I had started to get away from me. Once you know how to use it, it's a no-brainer.

I now remember one single password, which is my master-password[^fn-master] into LastPass. (Actually, that's a lie, I also know one password belonging to a client of mine.) That means I don't know hundreds of my passwords. That, in turn, means I am free to make them long and totally unintelligable.

[^fn-master]: Apparently it will take around 5389762 years _and 2 months_ to crack my master password. Find out [how long it will take to crack your favourite password](https://random-ize.com/how-long-to-hack-pass/).



The fact is… the computers trying to break into our passwords are always able to do so, given enough time. As they become more powerful, they take less time, so their chances of cracking the passwords are higher. However [the longer the password, the exponentially harder it is to crack](https://kennymuli.medium.com/password-cracking-is-easy-heres-how-to-do-it-875806a1e42a).

## Passwords

- Reverse engineering a hashed password (not really possible)

  

## Multi-factor security (MFA, 2FA)

- get yourself an app
- text messages to phones are not secure
- emails are not secure

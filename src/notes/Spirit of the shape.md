# Introduction
## Chinese standing post
Somewhere between a physical cultivation and a meditation practice. It involves arranging oneself in space to create a specific shape of the body like calligraphy strokes, and staying there for extended periods. For clear mind, improved health, martial power.

Rule of thumb: spending one half of practice moving, and the other half standing.

Be gentle in the body and mind. The quality of intention we employ seeps into the bones and meat.

# Approach
1. Book structure
2. First experience, then name
3. "Maximum comfort"
4. Letter of the law and spirit of the law
5. intermittent practice
6. up and down
7. mind the gap
8. breathing
9. cascades
10. discerning things buried
11. titrating tension

### 1. Book structure
There is a 1-2 rhythm of "doing", offering a few simple actions or intentions to apply or explore, followed by a "reflection" beat to help digest what was done.

### 2. First experience, then name
Knowing names creates an illusion of depth, but it also makes it harder to ask questions about something after hearing the name for it.

Look at the meat/tissue at the end of your leg without knowing what it's called. What would it be like if you could not know the name of something until you had explored and played with it for a year?

### 3. Maximum comfort
_Try hard_ is maximum effort, yet it's possible to learn most from the lazy man. We're not downplaying effort, but whether it is _effective_ or _proportionate_ to the outcome. Less can be more.
How much can happen from a state of comfort? Can you gradually increase the intensity or duration whilst maintaining comfort?

Mikhail Ryabko: it's like _buttering bread_: matter of fact, no heightened arousal, smooth strokes, measured strokes.

Play with a locked-out elbow. What happens to your breath? what happens when you change your breath? Could I _reel silk_ through my joints?

What is your litmus test for discomfort?

Discomfort also changes your mindset. How do you notice this?

Discomfort offers a range experience, but like a bowl of piping hot soup, we don't want to burn our mouth. Find your maximum comfort, then your edge of comfort, then go just past it. Notice the effects.

### 4. The spirit of the shape and the letter of it.
Akin to _omote_ and _ura_, the letter of the law is the specifics of the standing posture – things that are easy to see and assess (gestures) – and the spirit of the law is the sense of the posture without the extremes of placement, extension, compression, etc. Can you find the spirit of the law before you develop the strength/stamina for the letter of the law? Can you experience how the letter of the law grows out of the spirit?

### 5. Intermittent practice
Classic standing practice can take an hour or more, but there may be a large element of survivor bias to that story. These days, there are travelling teachers who only have a weekend to get their message across. Entering postures for a short period allows us to grow familiar with the challenge without getting overwhelmed by it. In time, we want to practice longer/deeper, but the way into that may be through shorter/periodic practice.

### 6. Up & down
When we reach our arms out, that's one feeling. When we reach our arms out having lengthened our spine up and released our tension down, that's a completely different feeling. Notice how your central line can support your limbs.

### 7. Mind the gap
_Every minute zen_ is not demanding a neurotic hypervigilance, rather an increased _casual_ capacity to notice, digest, and be interested. It's easy to _gap out_ through the movement, not noticing what happened between point A and point B. Everything else in this list serves to notice more and to _notice the gaps between noticing_.

### 8. Breathing
> We are not the musician playing our accordion; we are an accordion being played by an unknown musician. (Bruce Fertman)
1. inhale
2. exhale
3. wait
4. repeat
_Waiting_ is attending to what's wanted/required.

### 8. Cascades
Painful/challenging postures (e.g. _seiza_) arouse a local layer of tension or resistance. With a bit of patience, that layer starts to soften. As it does, notice how the tension ripples outward from the pressured point, notice too how softening can ripple outwards, cascading through the body.
This invites us to trust the tissues to release themselves.

### 9. Discerning things buried
The focus of standing is the load-bearing areas of the body, but anywhere in the body can experience contact and load. Can you feel the layers of (1) skin, (2) meat, (3) bone?

### 10. Titrating tension
Life is going to make you tense. We might as well work with that. We can find and increase a spot of tension, and then release it bit by bit (as in Systema). Can you feel the release radiating into the spot and the tissues around it?
Such _faux isometrics_ give us a taste of low-level chronic tension by consciously introducing bugs into our system. It also sets us up to be able to notice, pick out, and soften the tension.


# Moving
Different positions and options to encourage more awareness of the sensations and the capacity of the body to relax and support itself. The standing involves very small movements at best, so they are best released into the wider system by walking around or other such movements. You might book-end the practice with a particular movement (e.g. going for a walk).

- walking
- swinging arms around body
- dragon breathing //TODO: needs greater clarification (perhaps a YT video?)

Know also that the movement you are accustomed to actually has a thousand possibiities for variation

### Spirals and eddies
In turbulent water big swirls and eddies birth smaller and smaller ones. So too in movement through joints and limbs from the ground through the waist along the arms out the fingers. Allow and notice the swirls and eddies as they evolve, with no expectation or intellectual thinking about how it will end.

The most appropriate sensation that comes to mind is how the body feels when we yarn, the opening up and arcing ourselves; tissues feel _taut_ like elastic bands getting pulled, but they themselves are not tense.

Taut, not tight. Extending, instead of contracting.

So, in a motion, we try to glide and extend the tissues, joint by joint from the middle of the back, through the shoulders, the elbows, wrists to the fingertips. The tissues stretch out millimetre by millimetre. There is a gradual spiralling out so that the distance between fingertip and shoulder-blade seems longer at the end of the movement than at the start.

# Discovery and awakening
Imagine that the previous ideas could be touchstones, approaches that might be used interchangeably.

## Getting in touch with your roots

### Watching
Sit and gaze at your feet. Take your time. What do you see?

### Touching
After a while, place your hands on your feet and explore them.


## Lying
The semi-supine is the granddaddy of restorative positions. It is not an inert position! Remain active in your attention.

### Extending lines
Instead of stretching yourself out, explore what is binding you and unravel that. Instead of stretching your outsides to take up more space, have your insides expand and nudge outsides to make enough space for them.

### Sinking into the ground

### Canting
Rolling/leaning slightly to one side (an observer might not notice) to feel the weight more towards one side, noticing what tightens up. Then waiting for a shift.

## Sitting on the floor
## Kneeling _seiza_ & _kisa_
## Squatting
> Even the simplest human activity is no less a mystery than the pigeon's return home over great distances or the bee's construction of a hive. (Moshe Feldenkrais, _Awareness Through Movement_, 1972)

NB There are many semi-squatting positions that can support someone learning to squat.

## Rising from lying to standing
(The down creates the up)


By virtue of having minimal stresses to notice and attach to, the body becomes invisible (to me as well as others). All that remains is the feeling of the weight where we touch the environment; we are aware of interfaces, pressures on surfaces.

- Flynn Disney
- Tom Weksler


# A grasp that matches our reach

## Elbow calligraphy
Face a wall, toes touching, draw across the wall with your elbow, noticing if your shoulder disappears. Where do you _not_ move your elbow? Do you know why you don't go there? Is there a way to tease the edges of that boundary?

## Shoulder calligraphy with a book in 3d space
Like elbow, but with a light weight in your hand, and moving your hand around through space, not just in relation to a surface. Notice where tension and tiredness arise; can you adjust to release?

## Putting on/taking off gloves single-handedly
Do this with or without gloves.

This is an excellent book. It strikes me as a book for the advanced practitioner. Whatever the practice, people tend to look for the _right_ way to do something and then try to approach and perfect that. This book is not that. Refreshingly, it invites us to work inwards by starting where we are and learning what that means and feels like. As much (if not more) of the work is directed towards attending and noticing as is given to shape-making.

My current exploration is how notions of negative space found in art might have parallels in posture, movement, and martial arts. Negative space is almost always found _where you are not looking_, it's sensed by feeling _what you're not feeling_, and so on. This book's gentle entreaties to notice the gaps in attention, and then the gaps between the gaps, encourages us to open up to the possibility of working with the artist's negative space in other areas of life.

Having said that this book is for the advanced practitioner, that is only true inasmuch as it's true that advanced practitioners tend to be looking for something beyond the forms of physical precision. It is also a book for beginners, and might catapult them into the far reaches of their chosen art.

As with all books, its limitations are the limitations of language. Writing about physicality, tending to nuances, is always insufficient. Thankfully – for me at least – the words reach beyond the constraints of prose and aspire to a poetic understanding and rendering of the work. Your poetic abilities shine throughout, and frequently illuminate an aspect that wasn't quite clear when offered through prose.

I am not a _chi kung_ student, and this book – which is worming its way into me – won't make me one. The descriptions of particular postures or exercise cycles, even with drawings, leave me fretting about whether I've got it quite right (or, right enough). I would love to see the shapes being made on youtube or instagram (sadly, _dragon breathing_ doesn't appear on youtube in a form I could recognise from the book). Having said that, everything written here is equally applicable to _aikido_ exercises or even walking the dog, so I'm not as attached to the descriptions as I would be otherwise.

I have frequently repeated an old conclusion that the best books on aikido aren't on aikido at all, and I think this book has confirmed it anew. It's also an excellent book on aikido.

Bits that I'm also interested to read more on:
-   Breath – you mention Bruce's metaphor of us as accordions being played – when I spend awhile in a shape, my breathing tends to illuminate it by pushing against the shape from the inside, stretch and release, stretch and release.    
-   Hands - I have realised latterly just how acquisitive my hands are; they are eager to help and do so by leaping into action way before they should, until they end up permanently primed. Releasing their do-good desires is no small task, but it is momentarily transformational (again, Bruce writes about ugly hands being the outward manifestation of a tense body)    
-   The different densities of skin, meat and bone. You write somewhere about bones only revealing themselves as sudden lightness of weight. More!
-   What I'm thinking of as _negative space_ – it's almost the stuff that one can't write about, so maybe you shouldn't, but I figure you're very well placed to try!

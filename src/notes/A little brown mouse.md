Yes, really. 

The lawnmower stopped working at some point late last Summer, when its drive-belt slipped off its crankshaft. I peered at it accusingly, but it refused to jump back into place.

Fast forward to this Spring when I've been watching the grass extend upwards a millimeter or less per week, just to find that today it has leapt up several inches and is laughing at me. _Yes, everything in my garden has consciousness, and that consciousness is directed against me._

A while ago, when faced with a series of difficult conversations advocating for a daughter, I worked my way through (to successful resolution) by playing. More recently, I brought in a professional to fix some small plumbing problems just to have him make them worse. I realised that I had paid him to make the mess that I feared making myself. That gave me permission to pay myself to play with the more serious things that I feel woefully inadequate to handle.

So. This afternoon. Of course, I needed to empty the mower tank of petrol, which meant spilling much of it on the grass. Then I needed to take it apart, like an inverse striptease where I am revealing more and more useless stuff on the sexy motor.

Well, rusty motor. I finally worked out how to take of the blade, by careful positioning of my foot against it as I cranked the monkey wrench. It worked. It did not slice off my foot (which would have hurt more for being sliced with an entirely blunt and rusty once-upon-a-time blade).

Then I had a cowling to remove to access the belt. That was easier. Three screws and it lowered out. Some dried grass obviously fell out with it. 

Then a little brown mouse. We were both surprised.

It hid from me by nestling against the wall of the blade area in full view. Realising I could still see it, it nestled harder. Then it had a better idea. It ran off back into the shed.

As I fixed the belt and replaced everything (I think/hope), I spoke out to that mouse. I apologised for disturbing it, but strongly recommended that it doesn't go back into that particular hole, as I have fixed the mower and intend to use it tomorrow.

I hope my message got through!

### tl;dr

1. Breathe a long, slow inhale up the length of your back, feeling it encourage your head higher.
2. Allow a long, slow exhale to stroke down your front, releasing your ribcage, and encouraging a soft smile.
3. Reach out to the corners of the room in front of you, as if welcoming friends to your party.
4. Allow your arms and body to settle whilst that expansive state continues.
5. **Ask yourself, what would it be like in my body, right now, to have a little bit more _ease_?**

This 4-part opening and centering process has a secret fifth step. Everything else is a set-up to this, the all-important query: _what would it be like to have a little bit more of my chosen quality?_

The body will respond in its own sweet time, but the query invites us to open up to the possibility of further sensational input.

> Recall a moment when you were just about to taste something that promised to be delicious. Your mouth is open, you're salivating, your tongue is tasting the air, and the morsel is just below your nose releasing its flavour scents up to your nostrils to tantilise you. Do you recall that feeling, that thrill of _anticipation_?

> Or, recall when you first gazed on your lover's naked body, knowing that all you had to do was reach out to it. Can you remember that feeling, that electric thrill of _anticipation_?

> Or, perhaps, your first leap off the high-dive board? Or strapped in for a bungee jump? Or waiting to be called into your headteacher's office? Or waiting for the midnight call to say your father had died?

True enough, anticipation isn't always excitement, but it is always fully sensational.

Where does that level of sensation show up in your daily life? When it does, is it haphazard, or can you encourage it?

## Listen, carefully

The secret to the centering process is not to end it (_steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and done_) but to take an open-ended fifth step to encourage the adaptation to continue. Ask the question and then just hang out in _not-knowing_. That gives the body time to explore and formulate a response. It's all in the anticipation.

_What would it be like to have a bit more ease?_

Be humble, assume that there is always a response and that you might not be awake enough to recognise it or understand it. Remember that the body doesn't speak in words. Be patient – if not today, maybe tomorrow, or next week, or next month – the body _will answer_. Just keep asking the question with real curiosity and anticipation.

## A little bit more _ease_?

_Ease_ is my placeholder quality: when I don't have a specific quality I'm working with, I enquire about _ease_. It's a familiar to-and-fro so both my body and my conscious awareness are sensitive to the signals of _ease_. As such, it's a really good starting place, as if I am knocking on the door of my body to ask for help.

## What's an embodied quality?

So, what is it a placeholder for? Certain qualities are cerebral; others are of the body. I always try to choose a quality that my body already has experience of. After all, I'm asking it to look the quality up in the archives and re-create the structure for that quality. It won't help if I'm asking for something that the body has no reference for.

For example, part of this writing is to get myself used to greater _visibility_, so that may be the word on my mind at the moment. But it's not exactly the quality that my body has archived away. _Visibility_ requires a bit of unpacking.

Why have I chosen visibility? Because I know I have something of value, but I feel uncomfortable standing up to announce it or offer it. Why? Because others will look at me, will assess and judge me, and my previous experiences of that haven't felt safe. Fair enough.

With a bit of digging, it seems that being more visible is the context that I wish to hang out in, but it's not the quality. Perhaps it's being more _at ease_ with people looking at me. Perhaps, it's learning to be more _comfortable_ with discomfort. Perhaps it's developing greater _resilience_ in the face of judging eyes. Perhaps it's _steadfastness_, or _courage_, or _invisibility_[^fn-invisibility].

[^fn-invisibility]: I didn't expect to write _invisibility_ – it seems somewhat counter-intuitive. What could I mean by that? I have something of value to offer. Yet when I offer it, I feel as if they are looking at me. Well, of course they are, but they are looking at me to see the thing of value. Perhaps invisibility means allowing their eyes to land on the good, rather than on me. (How one becomes more invisible is not something you need to work out logically. It's precisely the question that the body will answer for you).

## Should haves, would haves, and ought-tos

Sometimes we think we _should have_ more of a particular quality. _I ought to be more patient with my children_. So we ask the body for that quality. But can you hear the pressure of that request? The _should have_ can weigh too heavily on the body. If so, that's not the quality for you right now. Maybe a another time, when the injunction has lessened somewhat.

## Anything worth doing is worth doing well

The body is responding to your question, but it needs time for that response to become clear _to you_, and for the body to adapt around the response (i.e. to make it meaningful and functional). So: take time. I work with my chosen quality for a year.

For the first two or three months, my enquiry is just surfacing the quality so that I become aware of the body's response. (If, by the end of the third month, I'm still not aware of a response, I choose a different word.) Then the investigation deepens, as I become more familiar with the body's reply, and the body becomes more adept at structuring that quality into being.

By the end of the year, my body is adding the quality before I've asked the question.

## In my humble opinion

Asking the question and waiting for a response, is itself a re-balancing of the relationship between mind and body. It takes some humility to sit with not knowing and to allow the body the time to shape its answer. That's a good thing.

Even so, it helps to locate and listen to the different voices within. Our different parts are intelligent in different ways and, by listening to them all, we receive a richer understanding of our wants and needs.

## Let me introduce you to ...

You.

You are a (wo-)man of many parts, no doubt. Meet three parts of you that offer three distinct types of intelligence. It's possible to consider these three parts abstractly as _thinking_, _feeling_, and _doing_, but I find it really helps to locate these centres in their own homes in the body.

### Head

At least in Western European culture (and its offshoots in American and Australasia), thinking occurs in the head, the location of the _mind_. This is the locus of our logical, rational, intellectual wisdom. Any activity that requires thinking (dealing with spreadsheets, problem-solving, etc.) will take place in the head.

### Heart

Ah, the centre of our feelings – love, compassion – our heart comes alive when we're inspired, when we get connected. When we do something _whole-heartedly_, we're all in. When we _wear our heart on our sleeve_ we let our feelings show. Similarly so when we _pour our heart out_ to a friend.

### Hara[^fn-hara]

[^fn-hara]: A Japanese term for the abdomen, I use it because I like the H-H-H-ness of the three centres combined (I'm sure there's a proper word for that).

Our abdomen is the centre of our physical structure, and as such it is _at the core_ of stabilising us to act. Often recognised by its absence (_I just don't have the guts_), it creates the foundation for courage, action, steadfastness, and so on.

### The original trinity?

These three centres have their own flavour of intelligence (cognitive, emotional, and active). But the question is this: _how often do you involve all three wisdoms in decision-making_? It might be that a particularly knotty problem isn't that difficult, it's just that I'm trying to solve it at the wrong level. It might be that I know what the right thing to do is (logically), but I just can't seem to do it (an emotional obstruction?).

We had a serious water leak a while ago, so we now have plumbing, electricity, and re-decorating to deal with. Three specialities. We might be very lucky finding a multi-talented handyperson, but the likelihood is we will need contributions from three domain-specific experts.



Why is our _whole_ being any different?

Seeking input from all three centres improves our chances of acting from a deeper wisdom.

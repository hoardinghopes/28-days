### <abbr title="Too long; didn't read">tl;dr</abbr>

There are two modes of engaging with others. The predominant mode places _I_ over the objectified other (_It_). This is the mode that modern man almost exclusively uses.

The second mode, which creates a unique and transforming relationship with the Other, has been neglected in the modern world to the detriment of us all.

Regaining this second mode will address our sense of lack of fulfilment and alienation because it restores a vital part of our humanity.

# Who am _I_?

_I_ by itself is not a meaningful unit. There cannot be an _I_ without an _Other_. I can only be _I_ when the unspoken other is understood. _I_ cannot exist in isolation. _I_ always references a relationship. There is always an unspoken _Other_.

In this written conversation, for example – between me the writer and you the reader – _I_ means I-in-relation-to-you. This particular voice _I_ cannot exist without _you_ the reader (although, when I write for you, you are still imaginary, to be found in the future).

## I don't exist beyond relationship

So we have a relationship, and every lone-standing _I_ is actually implicitly referring to _You_. I am shaped by my relationship with you, just as you are shaped by your relationship with me. Neither you or I exist _as we are_ beyond this relationship. Which is to say that we are as much our relationship as we are ourself.

Buber suggests that these relationships have two very different qualities and modes of engagement, which he names _I-Thou_ and _I-You_. Other authors have referred to them as _I-You_ and _I-It_. (I will use _I-Thou_ and _I-It_ as the opposing pairs).

## I and It

_I-It_ is a familiar mode of engaging with the world for most of us. In this mode, we collect data, analyse, classify, and theorise about it. The _It_ is a thing to be utilised, to be known, or to be put to some purpose. There is necessarily some distance between the experiencing _I_ and the experienced _It_. One is subject, and the other object.

It is, almost exclusively, how we get through our days in this world.

## I and Thou

Although _I-It_ is the predominant mode of engaging with the world, another is both possible and necessary if we are to be fully human. The mode of _I-Thou_ is one of encounter, where we enter into relationship with the object encountered, we participate in something with that object, and both the _I_ and the _Thou_ are transformed by the event of the relationship.

## The _It_ World

Having identified these two fundamental modes of engaging, Buber states that the modern world is entirely based upon the mode of _I-It_. Politics, economics, public institutions, even much of personal life, are all fundamentally grounded in the fact that we view every other being as an _It_, rather than as a _You_.

From there, it is a short step to recognising that the existential angst we all experience at points in our lives is the result of our strict reliance on our objectifying and objectified experience to the exclusion of _encounter_.

## Strange Encounters

The solution to the angst is to open ourselves up to _encounter_ and re-build our _I_ in relation to _You_. But every encounter is fleeting – as soon as we reflect upon the _You_ it perforce becomes an _It_ again.

We feel that there could be something more, something more lasting and fulfilling. This "more" is encounter with God or absolute relation. We cannot create this, but only ready ourselves for it.

Once we have experienced it, we are transformed, and we come to see every other being as a _You_, and gain a sense of loving responsibility for the whole world.

Thus we no longer feels alienated from the world and do not worry about the meaninglessness of life.

## That's all fine, in theory

So, finally, we get to my purpose here. Martin Buber has written a very important book. It is also very difficult to read, deliberately so. This is not something to be digested on a wet Sunday afternoon; it is something to be wrestled with, to be teased apart and put back together.

And I find that a struggle. I am not much of a thinker. At least, not without my body. If _I-It_ is my usual mode, it is my body's usual mode. For _I-Thou_ to be anything other than a theory, it has to grow and claim existence in my body, in my way of being.

## Enough! Let's practice!

I am slowly and gently exploring what this theory might mean. In relation to people. In relation to our dog. To the birds outside. To the trees and other non-human life in the garden. To the river and hills beyond the garden. To the stars at night, the rain and wind.

Of course, I can't try stuff out and then ask these non-speakers _how was it for you?_ so I am left to my own devices. Can I create space for transformation in my body and space such that I experience things differently?

I think I'm practising love, and I don't know what that means. All at the same time.

### <abbr title="Too long; didn't read">tl;dr</abbr>

1. **Breathe a long, slow inhale up the length of your back, feeling it encourage your head higher**
2. Allow a long, slow exhale to stroke down your front, releasing your ribcage, and encouraging a soft smile.

Once you can feel your verticality being moved by your breath, begin to attend to it while walking, or when changing postures, e.g. sitting down and standing up.

## Don't bring me down

Gravity doesn't care. It will drag us down to the earth, and smush us there until we are a pool a single atom deep. What prevents that? Our skeletal structure. How is that held in place? By a balance of uplift and release.
Align your skeleton, and you'll stay upright. You'll also be immobile.

As soon as we move, we are out of that perfect (impossible) alignment, and have to rely on something else to get us to the next position of alignment. That something else is the tensegrity of our bones demanding length and our sinews contracting around them.

## Watch the saplings grow!

Everything has growth spurts in the childhood stage. Saplings start out finger-thick and shoot up, their pliant branches reaching out and up. For the first couple of years, our fruit trees needed wooden supports to help them withstand the strong winds we get. They were intent on gaining height before they strengthened and stabilised their trunks.

_First they grow up and then they grow out._

Our children were the same. First of all, we notice them eating twice as much as a few days before. Then a few weeks later, we'd find that they hugged differently because they had grown taller. Then a few months later, we'd notice that their clothes had filled out as their body's girth caught up proportionately with their height. Then it all started again!

_First we grow up and then we grow out._

## Working with gravity

If you can raise your arm, and then allow it to drop like a dead weight, that's gravity. Do it again. Lift your foot a little way off the floor, and then drop it. Do it again.

Gravity is constantly coursing through our bodies, all the time, from the first splitting of the fertilised cell in the womb to the decomposition of the body in the coffin at the end of a lifetime.

Where do we live? In gravity^[[Just like fish don't know they're in water](https://sive.rs/fish).].

## Finding uplift

I should say first: rather than _doing_ the exercise, notice that _it happens_; rather than efforting into a new ideal position, find the ease that moves you along.

Even when we are sitting absolutely still, our breathing creates a cycle of up and down. Our ribcages lifts and expands, and then drops and subsides. Now the movement of the ribcage and the expansion of the belly at the front of the body are obvious, so let's move on to explore what's less obvious.

Can you feel expansion along the back of your body, can you feel an upwards sensation running lightly along your spine? Can you sense it lengthening your spine and raising your skull upwards? Not _much_, not even _a little_, less than _slightly_. Just the faintest whiff of upwards-ness.

When you notice that, you may find you have an option around the exhale. It is a release of pressure. It's up to you whether it's a collapse back down, or a release _around_ the verticality of the upright.

## Walking uphill

That same cycle that we've uncovered in breathing is available in walking too. There is a point in the gait cycle where the rear foot is released to swing forwards again. At that point, the standing leg is at its straightest with all your weight^[Your mass multiplied by gravity, if I remember my school physics correctly] dropping down through it.

Remember this law of physics? _Every action has an equal and opposite reaction_. Our weight bearing down through the standing leg creates an equal force running in the opposite direction up through the body. You know that already, but can you feel it?

## Ups and downs

Every movement has ups and downs within it. Even a downwards movement (if not a collapse) has to have up and down in equilibrium. That's quite a thought! Our adventure is to find the ups in the downs, and the downs in the ups.

Then we can choose how to respond to these complementary forces. Do I collapse with the down into a chair? Can I retrieve the up within it to guide myself downwards. Do I struggle up out of a chair? Can I find the down that makes the up effortless?

## and round and round

We are three dimensional beings, so our forces don't just travel up and down along a single plane, but they also have the ability to rotate around points (joints) and planes.

Moving up and down is linear. Moving forwards and backwards is linear. Combining up and down with forwards and backwards can generate torque: rotation.
We start swinging but, unlike a pendulum, we are swinging through multiple planes as we go.

## Practice makes possible

Whenever you think of it, draw a long slow breath up from the ground. Allow it to stroke up your legs, your back and neck, and your head. As you release the breath, allow your ribcage to soften around you spine, and your legs to ease more deeply into the ground^[If you don't know what I mean by that, ask your body to do it anyway, and take on the role of observer, not controller. Your body may understand better than you do!].

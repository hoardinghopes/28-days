  status: 1. It's hard to speak words to my body, and then translate my body's response back.
  effort: 4. I've been struggling with this for a while, and no matter how I write it, I'm not yet satisfied.

### <abbr title="Too long; didn't read">tl;dr</abbr>

1. Breathe a long, slow inhale up the length of your back, feeling it encourage your head higher.
2. **Allow a long, slow exhale to stroke down your front, releasing your ribcage, and encouraging a soft smile.**
   <!--3. Reach out to the corners of the room in front of you, as if welcoming friends to your party.-->
   <!--3. Allow your arms and body to settle whilst that expansive state continues.-->

The exhale softens us around the vertical axis (unless we allow collapse). This balances the body between up and down forces. As much as we are lengthened upwards, so we are released downwards.

To achieve this, we must find and melt current tensions, stiffnesses and flaccidities within the body, to replace them with length and release.

## Don't bring me down

[Gravity still doesn't care](/posts/you-lift-me-up/). But we perhaps we return today with a quiet, momentary awareness of the pulse riding up our back. If so, our exploration can move forwards. If not yet, take some time to [review the previous post](/posts/you-lift-me-up/), after all it took me a long time to find out for myself before I ever got round to writing about it. It's worth doing; let it take time.

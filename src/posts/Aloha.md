This fascinating exercise comes my study at Frankie Briers' _Wise Fool School_[^fn-frankie]. Each week of the course, he invited us to take on a practice and see what emerged from it. This particular week's exercise was _Aloha_[^fn-contd].

[^fn-frankie]: I highly recommend [this 6-week course](https://www.francisbriers.com/wise-fool-school). It's delightful, rather than demanding, and Frankie is a sparkly-eyed wise man. [Just watching him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3qQvdq10HA) is good for the heart. Finally, he's a poet – of course, how else can we get beyond the constraints of language – and has written a lovely [_Tao Te Ching_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tao-Ching-Ineffable-spiritual-translated-ebook/dp/B00TQ0J25E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=).

[^fn-contd]: Continued in [[Aloha revisited]].

> In Hawai'ian, _Aloha_ means both _hello_ and _goodbye_. And also: _love_. So we can say hello with love, and we can say goodbye with love.
>
> But you can also turn it around: the word also teaches you _how_ to love even when it's hard: keep saying hello and goodbye to whatever arises in the moment.

On the in-breath, say hello to whatever arises, whatever feeling or thought or sensation. Just say hello without worrying about it or getting attached to it. On the out-breath, say goodbye to whatever is there, even though it may linger.

Inhale, _hello_; exhale, _goodbye_.

> We can trap ourselves in a box with our beliefs just as much as we can armour ourselves with tension. We build a box labelled identity and sit squarely in it. But if someone approaches with love – who can really see me as I am _in this moment_ – they can set me free. Just being present and welcoming who I _actually_ am now. What an incredible gift!

So I went for a walk with our dog this morning, and as the path emerged from the scrub and trees onto the braes, the low moorlands, I started breathing in _Aloha_ and breathing out _Aloha_.

Dog bounded up. Hello Scallywag. And off again. Goodbye Scallywag.

Thoughts rushed forward, clamouring to be seen and spoken, but there was already an unruly queue, only kept in check by the cadence of my stride. Instead, I welcomed sounds: Hello hiss of distant cars; Goodbye hiss of distant cars. Hello peaceful birdsong; Goodbye peaceful birdsong.

Hello hills; Goodbye hills.

It is a mild winter/spring day today. My breath misted below my nose. I took my tops off one-by-one till bare-chested: Hello cold; Goodbye cold. Hello tingles and shivers; Goodbye tingles and shivers. Eventually, as I kept going up the path, a furnace-like heat emerged from within: Hello hot; Goodbye hot. My skin the membrane between the two.

My mind started wandering – how do I capture these moments, these alohas? How do I write the trees? the gorse? Oh! _Aloha_ deer crossing the path just before me.

Hello lengthening sinews, Goodbye twisting tissues. Hello view. Goodbye view out there.

Walking back down the path: Hello anxiety that I’ll bump into someone with my shirt off, what will they think? Goodbye opinions of imaginary others.

> Hello _idiot_. Goodbye _idiot_.
>
> Hello _fool_. Goodbye _fool_.
>
> Hello _stupid idiot_. Goodbye _stupid idiot_.
>
> Hello _wise fool_. Goodbye _wise fool_.
